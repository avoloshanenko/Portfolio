## About me
My name is Anzhelika Voloshanenko. I'm starting my journey to master software testing. This is the first thing that really interested me. Therefore, I want to develop in this direction. Thanks to my previous experience, I work excellently in a team and can take responsibility. And this year, I realized that I am very adaptable to various changes. In this portfolio, I would like to say about my knowledge of testing and showcase the technical skills gained from self-study.
